    Instance variables you have access to
        - self.epsilon (exploration prob)
        - self.alpha (learning rate)
        - self.discountRate (discount rate)

    Functions you should use
        - self.getLegalActions(state) which returns legal actions for a state

    Methods to Implement:

    def getQValue(self, state, action):
        Returns Q(state,action)
        Should return 0.0 if we never seen
        a state or (state,action) tuple

    def getValue(self, state):
        Returns max_action Q(state,action)
        where the max is over legal actions. Note that if
        there are no legal actions, which is the case at the
        terminal state, you should return a value of 0.0.

    def getPolicy(self, state):
        Compute the best action to take in a state. Note that if there
        are no legal actions, which is the case at the terminal state,
        you should return None.

    def getAction(self, state):
        Compute the action to take in the current state. With
        probability self.epsilon, we should take a random action and
        take the best policy action otherwise. Note that if there are
        no legal actions, which is the case at the terminal state, you
        should choose None as the action.

        HINT: You might want to use pacai.util.probability.flipCoin(probability)
        HINT: To pick randomly from a list, use random.choice(list)
